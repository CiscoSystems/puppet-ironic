puppet-ironic
===================================

Overview
--------

The ironic module will be a part of [Stackforge](https://github.com/stackforge), an effort by the Openstack infrastructure team to provide continuous integration testing and code review for Openstack and Openstack community projects not part of the core software. The module itself is used to flexibly configure and manage the baremetal service for Openstack.
